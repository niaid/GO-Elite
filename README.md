# GO-Elite
GO-Elite is designed to identify a minimal non-redundant set of biological Ontology terms or pathways to describe a particular set of genes or metabolites. Default resources include multiple ontologies (Gene, Disease, Phenotype), pathways (WikiPathways, KEGG, Pathway Commons), putative regulatory targets (transcription, microRNA, domains) and cellular biomarkers. 


This script takes a list or multiple list of protiens/genes peforms the GO-elite anlaysis then produces a pdf output using R.
